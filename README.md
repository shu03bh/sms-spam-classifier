**SMS Spam Classifier**

*Project Overview*
--This project is an SMS Spam Classifier that leverages machine learning to distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages. The primary goal of this classifier is to provide a simple, yet effective solution for filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful spam messages.

**Key Features**
1. Data Cleaning: Thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed the SMS dataset to remove any inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to gain insights into the dataset, including message length distributions and word frequency.
3. Text Preprocessing: Applied text preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal to transform the raw text into a suitable format for modeling.
4. Model Building: Developed and trained a machine learning model to accurately classify messages as spam or ham.
5. Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability.
6. Improvement: Iteratively improved the model through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
7. Frontend Integration: Integrated the model with a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input messages and get real-time classification results.
8. Deployment: Deployed the application, making it accessible for public use.
9. Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

--**Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git
cd sms-spam-classifier

--**Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

--**Run the Application:** Start the Streamlit application:
streamlit run app.py

--**Access the Application:** Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the SMS Spam Classifier.


**Dataset**
The classifier was trained on a labeled dataset containing over 5,500 SMS messages, each categorized as spam or ham. The dataset includes diverse examples of spam messages, helping the model learn to identify different types of spam content.
